# testdata

This is the testdata folder for the go tests!

## `example_puppet_project`

A simplified version of the [`manifests`](/manifests) folder (used by the
integration tests.) This contains just the "first commit" version of each file
and no vendored puppet code. It's just used to test things like finding node
and module definitions in `hecklerd`.
